FUTURE_ML_02 – Support Ticket Classification & Priority Prediction

Domain: Machine Learning
Track Code: ML
Internship ID: [FIT/JAN26/ML5123]

Task Overview
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that automatically classifies customer support tickets into categories and predicts their priority level using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning.
It was completed as part of the Machine Learning Internship at Future Interns, with the goal of reducing manual workload and improving support response efficiency.


Dataset
Name: Customer Support Tickets Dataset
Source:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com
The dataset contains real-world customer support scenarios across multiple departments.

Tools & Libraries
Language: Python 3.x
Environment: Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

Libraries Used:
-Pandas & NumPy → Data handling
-NLTK → Text preprocessing and lemmatization
-Scikit-learn → TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, Evaluation
-Matplotlib & Seaborn → Visualization
-Re (Regex) → Text cleaning


Methodology
-Data Preprocessing
Combined Ticket Subject + Ticket Description into a single text column
Converted text to lowercase
Removed special characters using regex
Removed stopwords (NLTK)
Applied lemmatization
Feature Engineering
TF-IDF Vectorization
max_features = 5000

-Model Training
Two separate models were trained:
1️⃣ Ticket Category Prediction Model
Target: Ticket Type
Algorithm: Logistic Regression

2️⃣ Ticket Priority Prediction Model
Target: Ticket Priority
Algorithm: Logistic Regression with class_weight='balanced'

-Train-Test Split
80% Training
20% Testing

Random State = 42

Model Evaluation

Evaluation Metrics Used:

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Cross-Validation (5-Fold)

Cross-validation results confirmed good generalization with minimal overfitting.

Visualizations
1. Ticket Category Distribution
Shows how tickets are distributed across departments.

2. Confusion Matrix – Category Prediction
Helps identify misclassification patterns between ticket types.

3. Priority Classification Report Visualization
Shows precision, recall, and F1-score per priority level.


Prediction System
A reusable prediction function was created:

predict_ticket("My account is locked and I need urgent access")



Business Impact
This system can:

- Reduce manual ticket sorting workload
- Automatically route tickets to the correct department
- Detect urgent issues faster
- Improve customer support efficiency
- Support SLA compliance

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the real-world application of:
-Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-Text Vectorization using TF-IDF
-Multi-output Machine Learning Classification
-Model Evaluation and Cross-Validation

The developed system successfully predicts both ticket category and priority level, making it highly useful for automated customer support environments.
